> Request: Okay, so let's check this out. So this is really cool, right? So she created the command. She created this giant execution statement and we got a couple of outputs here. We have, you know, our creatives, our creative commands and then we also have our delete commands that failed. So something went wrong here and I think it's because let me look at exactly how this delete user works. user ID might just be a single ID. So yeah, that looks right. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to ask Ada to correct this for us, right? So I'll say Ada, rerun the delete commands, but only use the actual user ID. So not the user underscore prefix. Just use the numbers for the deletion.

**Ada's Command:** 
```bash
uv run python commands/template.py delete-user 11 --confirm && uv run python commands/template.py delete-user 22 --confirm && uv run python commands/template.py delete-user 4 --confirm
```

**Output:** 
```
User with ID 11 deleted.
User with ID 22 deleted.
User with ID 4 deleted.
```
